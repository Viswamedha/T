File Manipulation:

a = file.open("file.txt","r/a")
b = file.readlines/read/writelines/append()
a.close()

String manipulation:

b.ljust/b.rjust (30) adjusts to fit in 30 spaces

strip - removes a certain character(s) from a word/ variable
split - seperates a list from a certain character
indexing - each word/character gets a value
print(a, end == "")
Appending lists - editing lists
center = prints the word in the center of a certain amount of spaces



operators:

<
>
<=
>=

**
*
/
+
-

random:
random.choice     #chooses a random option in a list
random.randint(20,30)   #Chooses a random number between 20 and 30

time:
time.sleep(5)   # waits for 5 seconds

loops:
bob = true
while bob:
	print("hi")


list = (bob,blob,jeffbob)
for i in list:
	print("hi")

function - some code which does a certain operation that can be called on:
def func(word):
	print(word)

a = func(bob)

Classes:
class print1:
	
	def __init__(self, word):
		self.word = word

	def print(self):
		print(self.word)

a = print1("blob")
a.print()
